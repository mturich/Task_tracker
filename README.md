# The task tracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5 and with the use of a fake REST API from JSON Server `https://github.com/typicode/json-server`. This project was inspired by `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8`.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Fake REST API

Run `json-server --watch db.json` for the fake REST server. Navigate to  `http://localhost:3000/posts/`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
